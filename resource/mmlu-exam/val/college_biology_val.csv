Adaptations of plants to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures include which of the following?,Numerous stomata,Thin cuticles,Spines instead of leaves,Large surface-to-volume ratios,C
"Nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron begins at the growth cone, located at the tip of the axon. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. Exposure of the neuron to cytochasalin B at this stage of development causes",microtubules in the axon to undergo reversible dissociation,microtubules in the axon to undergo irreversible dissociation,microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization,microfilaments in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization,C
"Based on the characteristic population curves that result from plotting population growth of a species, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is to",maintain the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve,opt for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached,reduce the carrying capacity cif the environment to lower the K value,increase the mortality rate,C
All of the following characteristics are typical of r-selected species EXCEPT,high reproductive rate,small body size,occupancy of unstable environments,high competitive ability,D

How do cyanobacteria differ from green unicellular algae?,Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds.,Cyanobacteria lack cell walls.,Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.,Green algae produce cell membranes.,C
Which of the following is a biological attribute that would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution?,Extreme habitat specialization,K-selected reproductive rate,Limited dispersal abilities,Capacity for long-distance dispersal,D
Brood parasites such as the cuckoo successfully trick other species of birds into rearing their young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because,"on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry",the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species,"on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own",the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced,A
