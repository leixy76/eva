"As part of the Womenâ€™s Health Study, researchers investigated the role of systemic inflammation in predicting cardiovascular disease in women (N Engl J Med. 2002;347[20]:1557-1565). Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:",There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,A
Positive stranded RNA viruses have which of the following characteristics?,Their genome RNA can be translated directly as mRNA,They have to transcribe their genome RNA to a mirror image copy as a mRNA,This genome is circular,Their RNA genome is segmented,A
Common cold viruses are ubiquitous and invade by which route?,Faecal oral route,Respiratory and surface route,Cuts in the skin,Sexual transmission,B
A quasi species virus such as influenza and HIV has which of the following characteristics?,A fragmented or segmented genome,Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants,Possesses RNA and DNA,A very large genome,B
"A new drug with in vitro activity against HIV is tested on a population of patients with Western-blot confirmed HIV infections. Out of the 200 individuals in the patient population, 100 are chosen by lottery to receive the drug. The drug, which is tasteless, is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice. Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is determined for all of the subjects. This is an example of a",Case-control study,Case report,Cohort study,Cross-sectional study,A

Which is the exception in the following range of disease symptoms caused by bunyaviruses?,Pneumonias,Haemorrhagic fever,Hepatitis,Impaired renal function,D
How do viruses of the calcivirus family replicate?,As negative strand RNA viruses,As positive strand RNA viruses,Retroviruses,Using genetic reassortment,B
What does the reproductive number of a virus tell us?,How virulent the infection will be,How many people will die,How many contacts will be infected from one case,How long the 'incubation period' will be,C
