"A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?",1 N,2 N,3 N,4 N,C
