"In a pipelined RISC computer where all arithmetic instructions have the same CPI (cycles per instruction), which of the following actions would improve the execution time of a typical program?
I. Increasing the clock cycle rate
II. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline
III. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time",I only,II only,III only,I and III,D
"Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?","If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.","If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.","If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.","If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.",C
"Which of the following is (are) true about virtual memory systems that use pages?
I. The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.
II. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.
III. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.",I only,II only,I and II,I and III,A
"Consider the collection of all undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges. Let M and m, respectively, be the maximum and minimum number of connected components in any graph in the collection. If a graph has no selfloops and there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes, which of the following is true?","M = 10, m = 10","M = 10, m = 1","M = 7, m = 4","M = 6, m = 4",C
"Of the following, which gives the best upper bound for the value of f(N) where f is a solution to the recurrence f(2N + 1) = f(2N) = f(N) + log N for N >= 1, with f(1) = 0?",O(log N),O(N log N),O(log N) + 0(1),O((log N)^2),D
"Let P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself (i.e., is recursive). If P is guaranteed to terminate, which of the following statements must be true?
I. P has a local variable.
II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.
III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.",I only,II only,I and II only,II and III only,D
"Which of the following considerations applies (apply) to choosing the page size in a paging system?
I. An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.
II. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.
III. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously.",I only,II only,I and III only,"I, II, and III",D
