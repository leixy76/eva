"A girlfriend lived with her boyfriend in a small apartment. The boyfriend was a gun enthusiast who kept a collection of antique pistols and firearms in the apartment. The boyfriend was also an avid baseball fan and had a fanatic devotion to his favorite team. One evening, the boyfriend was watching his beloved team play their archrival on television. His favorite team lost in extra innings. After the game, the boyfriend became despondent and told his girlfriend that he was so disgusted that he was going to kill himself. The boyfriend took one of the pistols from his gun collection and shot himself in the head. As the boyfriend fell to the floor, wounded, his girlfriend couldn't believe her eyes. At first she thought that she should call 911 for an ambulance. But she was afraid that the police might think that she was responsible for the shooting. Consequently, she decided to do nothing. She proceeded to leave the apartment and spent the night at her mother's home. The boyfriend did not immediately die from the gunshot wound. A subsequent medical examiner's report concluded that the boyfriend died from loss of blood approximately two hours after the shooting. If the girlfriend had sought immediate medical assistance, the boyfriend would have lived. The girlfriend is subsequently prosecuted for her boyffiend's death. She should be found",guilty of first-degree murder.,guilty of second-degree murder.,guilty of involuntary manslaughter.,"not guilty, because she had no legal duty to render assistance.",C
"During a baseball game, a spectator watching the game started taunting one of the players for striking out. Annoyed by the taunts, the player started an argument with the umpire. When the umpire told the player to be quiet and go back to his team's bench, the player became enraged and savagely attacked the umpire, hitting him in the head with a bat. The spectator who had taunted the player was overcome by humiliation and horror at what occurred, because he was a good friend of the umpire. The spectator suffered no physical injury, but experienced severe nervous shock and brooded over the incident for months. If the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the baseball player, the spectator will","win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous.","win, because he was present and witnessed the attack.","lose, because he was partly responsible for causing the attack to occur.","lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator.",D
"A center and a quarterback were 14-year-old eighth graders at the local high school. They were both members of the school's junior varsity football team. The center weighed 170 pounds and was stocky in build. The quarterback was lanky and weighed about 145 pounds. The center and the quarterback often engaged in friendly tests of strength, such as arm wrestling and weight lifting contests, to see who was stronger. One afternoon, both youngsters were in the school gymnasium getting ready for football practice. As they were putting on their football uniforms, the center turned to the quarterback and said, ""Hey, weakling, why don't you punch me in the chest with your best shot?"" The quarterback replied, ""No, I'm afraid I might hurt you. "" The center then said, ""Are you kidding? You can't hurt me. C'mon, give me your best shot. "" The center stood up, stuck out his muscular chest, and prepared to have the quarterback hit him. The quarterback proceeded to cock his fist and then punched the center in the chest as hard as he could. Immediately thereafter, the center slumped to the floor, gasping for air. Realizing that the center was seriously hurt, the quarterback tried to render assistance but to no avail. Seconds later the center stopped breathing and died. Unknown to either the center or the quarterback, the center had a defective heart and suffered a heart attack as a result of the blow to the chest. In a wrongful death action, the quarterback will likely","be held responsible, because he committed a battery by hitting the center in the chest.","be held responsible, because the center's consent was ineffective.","not be held responsible, because the center's consent was effective.","not be held responsible, because the quarterback delivered the punch with greater strength than the center anticipated.",C

"A defendant was arrested at an airport when the small suitcase he was carrying was found to contain heroin. The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is","objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.","objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.","permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.","permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.",C
"The state constitution in one state guaranteed the right to marry to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?","Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.","Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.","No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.","No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.",A

"A resident in an exclusive residential area is a marine biologist. To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely","recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.","recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.","not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.","not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.",D
"An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?","The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.","The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.","Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.","The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",B

"In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer.

A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures.

Although the vintner did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the vineyard twice a week. The vintner recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a farmer, the investor signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. Before the farmer had paid the investor and taken his deed, the farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence.

"Two men were told by the defendant that a medical devices company was now using the old warehouse on the river for storing its supply of defibrillators. Late one night, the two men broke into the warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of defibrillators onto their truck.

"A man and a woman were arrested and charged with bank robbery. After receiving Miranda warnings, both requested an attorney. Following their arrests, the man and the woman were placed in separate jail cells. The next day before arraignment, the man asked a police officer if he could see his friend, the woman. The man was taken to the woman's jail cell and allowed to talk to her. Neither defendant knew that the police had placed a listening device in the woman's jail cell. As a result, their conversation was being overheard and recorded by the police. The police planted the listening device without first securing a warrant.

"A resident announced his candidacy for state representative. A law in the state requires new political entrants, regardless of party affiliation, to obtain five times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. On the substantive constitutional issue regarding the validity of the authenticating requirement, the most probable judicial resolution will be to",hold the authenticating requirement unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,hold the authenticating requirement unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,dismiss the cause of action because state election procedures are a sovereign state function.,assign the burden of proving the validity of the authenticating requirement to thestate.,D
"A state university was the scene of campus protests against nuclear weapons. A group of students painted purple a statue of the university's founder in protest to the university's federally subsidized nuclear weapon experimental studies. The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: ""Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid. ""The group leader was married to a fellow student. However, in light of his involvement in defacing the statue and the loss of his state aid, his wife left him. At that time, the group leader received a tax bill for $150. This tax was imposed uniformly by the city on all individuals over 19 years of age, with the exception that full-time female college students were exempted. The tax notice stated that his wife, 22 years of age, qualified for the exemption, and there was no bill enclosed for her. Subsequently, the group leader moved in with his new girlfriend and began making arrangements to secure a divorce. However, the group leader was not able to obtain a divorce, since he had not fulfilled the 12-month residency requirement as imposed by state law. In an action by the group leader against the state challenging the constitutionality of the state statute regarding disruptive campus activities in order to regain his $5,000 annual grant, the court will most likely declare the statute","constitutional, because it promotes a compelling state interest.","constitutional, because it is a proper exercise of state action designed to regulate the activities of state university students.","unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad.","unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory on its face.",C

The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect ""unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business.

"A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:""No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. ""Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. ""At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute","constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.","constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.","unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.","unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",B

When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?","The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.","The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.","The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.",B
