The term Schwarzschild radius usually describes properties of ...,red dwarfs.,pulsars.,black holes.,galaxies.,C
Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. The best evidence for this is:,Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts.,Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.,The Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface.,The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface.,B
Pluto's extremely cold (~40 K) surface is composed of:,mainly water ice which always remains frozen,nitrogen methane and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion,nitrogen methane and carbon monoxide ices which always remain frozen,roughly half ices and half rocky materials,B
What is the significance of the 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system?,The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.,It makes the orbit of Io slightly elliptical.,It creates a gap with no asteriods between the orbits.,It prevents formation of the ring material into other moons.,B
What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?,Asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system throw sand-sized particles into space and occasionally the Earth passes through a cloud of these particles which burn up in our atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.,Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.,Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.,The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.,D
The name of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way is ...,Altair A*,Alsephina A*,Fomalhaut A*,Sagittarius A*,D
What about asteroids makes them stand out in sky surveys searching for them?,Asteroids emit pulsed radiation,Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation,They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars,Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars,D
Which of the following is/are common feature(s) of all fresh (i.e. not eroded) impact craters formed on solid surfaces:,ejecta,raised rims,central peaks,A and B only,D
What element is most common among the Jovian Planets?,Hydrogen,Helium,Carbon,Oxygen,A
The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because,the entire planets are made mostly of metal.,radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.,metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.,metals differentiated to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.,D
What is not true of Jupiter's magnetic field?,it is about 20000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field,"it traps charged particles from Io's volcanoes in a ""plasma torus"" around the planet",it causes spectacular auroral displays at Jupiter's north and south poles,it switches polarity every 11 years,D
Which of these has NOT been one of the main hypotheses considered for the origin of the Moon?,The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces.,The Moon was captured into Earth orbit.,The Earth and Moon co-accreted in the solar nebula.,Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it.,A
According to the Solar Nebular theory what are asteroids and comets?,They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.,They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.,They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.,They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.,D
Besides large astronomical objects astrophysicists are also interested in small particles from space. Which one of these particles has the weakest interactions with other particles?,µ Muons,Antiparticles,ν Neutrinos,π Pions,C
Suppose you live on the Moon. How long is a day (i.e. from sunrise to sunrise)?,about 18 years,24 hours,29 Earth days,a year,C
